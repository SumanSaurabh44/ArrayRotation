# ArrayRotation
The task is to rotate an array of integers left by a specified number of positions, handling overflow and negative values gracefully. Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] rotated 2 positions left gives [3,4,5,6,7,1,2]. Rotating 8 positions left yields [2,3,4,5,6,7,1]. Negative values are handled gracefully.
